# PAWI
IT Project by bachelor's students Dorus Janssens and Lucas Schn√ºriger at the [Lucerne School of Information Technology](https://www.hslu.ch/en/lucerne-school-of-information-technology/). The goal is an iOS App to augment marble tracks by [cuboro](https://cuboro.ch) with ARKit, CoreML and Vision. Find out more about the project in the [wiki](https://github.com/eduDorus/PAWI/wiki). All documentation is in German.

## Documentation
The documentation is written with LaTeX. For code examples the `minted` package is used, which requires the Python packaged `Pygments`. Go through the following steps to be able to compile the documentation (uses VS Code and the LaTeX Workshop Extension):
1. Install Pygments with `pip install Pygments`, it might already be installed
2. Add `-shell-escape` to `latexmk` arguments in the setting `latex-workshop.latex.tools`
3. Add `*.lol` to the filetypes to clean in the setting `latex-workshop.latex.clean.fileTypes`

### Usage
- Insert images with the command: `\bild{WIDTH}{LABEL}{CAPTION}`. The width is relative to textwidth (1=fullsize, 0.5=half). To reference an image use `\ref{fig:LABEL}`.
- Insert Swift code blocks with the `code` environment, to reference it use `\ref{code:LABEL}`.
  ```
  \begin{code}{LABEL}{CAPTION}
    Swift code ...
  \end{code}
  ```
